SwiftUI is the new hotness right now, however not everyone is willing or able to go 'all in' on it just yet. For those of us still working away under UIKit, I wanted to share a technique I have been using for a while now to deal with constructing a UI hierarchy and managing navigation.

## Coordinators

You've likely all heard about, and possibly tried, [Coordinators](https://khanlou.com/2015/01/the-coordinator/), a fantastic pattern by [Soroush Khanlou](https://twitter.com/khanlou). I used this pattern myself for a long time. It solved the problem of decoupling navigation from View Controllers so that they could potentially be reused under any number of different scenarios. 

As I used this pattern more and more I would often feel some recurring, nagging, issues. I began to notice things like: 

- I was never able to settle on a single abstraction that I liked to use the pattern across any application... there were always subtle differences.
- There was often state to manage with regard to adding and removing children as they execute ("sub" Coordinators).
- This often meant you needed to know when a child Coordinator would be finished so you could clean them up.

The more I thought about this I began to realize that each Coordinator not only managed a specific [Container Controller](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/view_controllers) but that it's behaviour ended up copying its Containers behaviour. It felt like I was reinventing something that already existed over and over. Navigation based Coordinators ended up mostly pushing things. Tab based Coordinators were mostly managing an array of child Coordinators. 

I was essentially writing Coordinators to do the jobs that the UIKit Containers already do ü§î


## Container Controllers as Coordinators

I decided to try subclassing Containers to act as Coordinators, and once I did something pretty cool happened... 

- I no longer had to think about an abstraction: if I wanted a stack based Coordinator I simply subclassed `UINavigationController`. If I needed a tab based one I could subclass `UITabBarController` and load it up with my `UINavigationController` subclasses.
- The state for managing the 'graph' is gone as the subclasses deal with this by design. Now all they contain are the functions for moving between View Controllers or other Containers.
- I don't really care about when a flow is 'complete' anymore. When a ViewController is 'popped' from the stack, for example, it simply cleans itself up.

I now found I was able to build each Coordinator, in isolation, and not have to think about how it interacted with other Coordinators. 

Consider a simple app with a couple of tabs. A tab with a list of friends and a tab with a list of messages between you and those friends. Let's look at what this might look like using Containers as Coordinators.

First we have our View Controllers for the lists of friends and messages:

```swift
class FriendListViewController: UITableViewController {
  //..
}
class MessageListViewController: UITableViewController {
  //..
}
```

We know that we will want stack based navigation for each tab so let's build our `UINavigationController` subclasses for each of them:

```swift
class FriendListNavigationController: UINavigationController {
  init() {
    super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)
    
    let viewController = FriendListViewController()
    viewController.title = "Friends"
    setViewControllers([viewController], animated: false)
  }
}

class MessageListNavigationController: UINavigationController {
  init() {
    super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)
    
    let viewController = MessageListViewController()
    viewController.title = "Messages"
    setViewControllers([viewController], animated: false)
  }
}
```

Finally let's create our `UITabBarController` subclass to manage these:

```swift
class HomeTabController: UITabBarController {
  init() {
    super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)

    let users = FriendListNavigationController()
    users.tabBarItem = .init(title: "Users", image: nil, selectedImage: nil)
    
    let messages = MessageListNavigationController()
    messages.tabBarItem = .init(title: "Messages", image: nil, selectedImage: nil)
    
    setViewControllers([users, messages], animated: false)
  }
}
```

If we now compose all of these layers together at run time we end up with an application that looks something like:

| Friends Tab | Messages Tab |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <img src="/public/images/container-coordinators/tab1.png" alt="Friends tab" style="zoom:50%;" /> | <img src="/public/images/container-coordinators/tab2.png" alt="Messages tab" style="zoom:50%;" /> |

Notice that the `UINavigationController` related properties like `title` are handled by the `UINavigationController` subclasses and the `UITabBarController` related properties like `tabItem` are handled by the `UITabbarController` subclasses. This further decouples the individual View Controllers from the context they are being shown in.

Now that we have decoupled the hierarchy, what about navigation?


## The Responder Chain

Unless you have a lot of experience with building for macOS you may have never _explicitly_ used the [Responder Chain](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/touches_presses_and_gestures/using_responders_and_the_responder_chain_to_handle_events) on iOS, except perhaps the `becomeFirstResponder()` function.

The Responder Chain is based on the class `UIResponder`. All the common UIKit objects you use inherit from this including `UIViewController`, `UIView`, `UIWindow`, and `UIApplication`. There are a lot of interesting members on this class but for our needs we are only interested in one:

```swift
open var next: UIResponder? { get }
```

Why is this one so interesting? Well, if all the items in our view hierarchy implement this it means we basically have a linked list. From any place in the hierarchy we can walk back up the Responder Chain all the way back to the `UIApplicationDelegate`. 

By default, `next` will be:

- For `UIView`s, the `superview` or the `UIViewController` if it's the root view.
- For `UIViewController`s, the containing/presenting view controller or the `UIWindow` if it's the root View Controller.
- For `UIWindow`s, the `UIApplication`
- For `UIApplication`s, the `UIApplicationDelegate` if it is a `UIResponder`  

We can even alter the chain by overriding `next` in our subclasses if needed! This gives us an incredibly powerful mechanism, so how can we take advantage?


## Tapping into UIResponder

Now we know _what_ the Responder Chain is; how can we use it for navigation? Well it turns out that we can extend `UIResponder` with our own custom functions. We can then override these functions elsewhere to perform whatever action is required.

Knowing this, let's look at how we can navigate to a friend's details when a user taps one from the list. First let's add our `UIResponder` extension

```swift
extension UIResponder {
  @objc func selectedFriend(_ friend: Friend) {
    guard let next = next else { 
      // This gives us a nice piece of diagnostic information in the event
      // this action travels along the chain and isn't handled by anything
      return print("‚ö†Ô∏è Unhandled action: \(#function), Last responder: \(self)")
    }
    
    next.selectedFriend(friend)
  }
}
```

This will expose a `selectedFriend(_:)` function to _anything_ on the Responder Chain. Now that we have a way to send the message, let's do so from our friends list:

```swift
class FriendListViewController: UITableViewController {
  //..
  
  override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) {
    selectedFriend(data[indexPath.row])
  }
}
```

Finally we need something to act on this message, so let's do that from our `UINavigationController` subclass:

```swift
class FriendListNavigationController: UINavigationController {
  //..
  
  override func selectedFriend(_ friend: Friend) {
    let viewController = FriendDetailsViewController(friend: friend)
    viewController.title = friend.name
    pushViewController(viewController, animated: true)
  }
}
```

And that's it! Our `FriendListViewController` sends a message out that a certain friend needs to be shown and nothing more. The message travels along the responder chain until it hits our `UINavigationController` subclass that contains the override. Our subclass then constructs the appropriate View Controller and pushes it on to the stack.

We have performed all the work of a Coordinator without re-inventing the wheel. 


## Reusing View Controllers

After putting in the work to decouple our View Controllers, how we can leverage this new pattern in our app? Let's look at how we might reuse our friends list to select a friend to use when creating a new message. 

You can think of the Containers as the things that provide _context_ or _meaning_ to a View Controllers actions. Our existing `FriendListNavigationController` translates our `selectedFriend` action into showing a friends details on the current stack. The context here being the 'friends tab'.

For this feature we have a new context, so let's create a new Container to deal with it:

```swift
class NewMessageNavigationController: UINavigationController {
  init() {
    let viewController = FriendListViewController()
    viewController.title = "Select Recipient"
    setViewControllers([viewController], animated: false)
  }
  
  override func selectedFriend(_ friend: Friend) {
    let viewController = MessageComposerViewController(recipient: friend)
    viewController.title = friend.name
    setViewControllers([viewController], animated: true)
  }
}
```

So within this Container we start by showing the friends list, however this time when the user selects someone we will reset the stack to show the composer with the selected friend. We have used our existing friends list in a new context with very little code.

The only thing left to do is update our existing `MessageListNavigationController` Container to launch this new one:

```swift
class MessageListNavigationController: UINavigationController {
  init() {
    super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)
    
    let viewController = MessageListViewController()
    viewController.title = "Messages"
    viewController.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem = .init(title: "New", style: .plain, target: self, action: #selector(composeNewMessage))
    setViewControllers([viewController], animated: false)
  }
  
  //..
  
  @objc private func composeNewMessage() {
    let container = NewMessageNavigationController()
    present(container, animated: true, completion: nil)
  }
}
```

We have updated the existing Container to attach a navigation item that launches our new message composer Container. Notice that the View Controllers are still blissfully unaware of how they are being used. It is the Containers that contain the details about how they all come together.


## Other interesting uses

There are a few other interesting things the Responder Chain allows us to do. 

### UIViews

The fact that smaller components like `UIView` are `UIResponder`s means they can also participate in both sending and acting on our custom actions. A `UITableViewCell` subclass, for example, could call our `selectedFriend` action rather than the View Controller.

### Error Handling

We could also use this as a way to unify error handling. For example you might consider an extension like: 

```swift
extension UIResponder {
  @objc func handleError(_ error: Error) {
    guard let next = next else { 
      return print("‚ö†Ô∏è Unhandled action: \(#function), Last responder: \(self)")
    }
    
    next.handleError(error)
  }
}
```

Using this you can propagate errors from anywhere in your hierarchy back to a single place, like your `UIWindow`. Remember, the `UIWindow` can be a custom subclass just like your other Containers. You can present a generic error alert from there by overriding `handleError`.

### IBAction

You can also add `@IBAction` to your `UIResponder` extensions; doing this will allow you to call them with `UIButton` taps with no code at all. 

### Pay it forward!

Finally don't forget you are dealing with a linked list! Just because you override one of these custom actions doesn't mean you have to end the chain. You might want to update your UI based on the fact that an error occured but not mess with the default handling you have in your `UIWindow` i.e.:

```swift
class MyViewController: UIViewController {
  //..
  
  override func handleError(_ error: Error) {
    // do something with this controllers appearance
    
    next?.handleError(error) // pass the message along!
  }
}
```


## Caveats

There are a few things you need to know if you would like to give this pattern a try.

### Swift

This is an Objective-C mechanism (You may have noticed the `@objc` on our `UIResponder` extensions) and as such pure Swift code is not 'visible'. This means that, by default, you cannot pass along things like structs. To work around this we can box our Swift value in an Objective-C compatible object:

```swift
public class ResponderBox: NSObject {
  @nonobjc private let value: Any
  
  @nonobjc public init<T>(_ value: T) {
    self.value = value
    super.init()
  }
  
  @nonobjc public func value<T>(_: T.Type = T.self) -> T {
    guard let value = value as? T else {
      fatalError("Invalid value. Expected \(T.self), found \(type(of: self.value))")
    }
    
    return value
  }
}
```

The unfortunate downside is that you'll need two `UIResponder` functions to make this work, taking our `selectedFriend` example we would need to update it to be:

```swift
extension UIResponder {
  @objc func selectedFriend(_ friend: ResponderBox) {
    guard let next = next else { 
      return print("‚ö†Ô∏è Unhandled action: \(#function), Last responder: \(self)")
    }
    
    next.selectedFriend(friend)
  }
  func selectedFriend(_ friend: Friend) {
    selectedFriend(.init(friend))
  }
}
```

For the objects sending the action nothing changes. They can still call `selectedFriend(someFriendStruct)`. This function will then box up the struct and call out to the Objective-C compatible version.

For the objects wanting to act on this they would instead now override the `ResponderBox` version and extract the underlying struct with code like:

```swift
override func selectedFriend(_ friend: ResponderBox) {
  let friend: Friend = friend.value()
  
  // use friend struct
}
```

This is a small inconveience, however the good news is you can't really mess this up. For sending it doesn't matter if you accidentally called the `ResponderBox` version as they both result in the action being sent along the Responder Chain. As for the overrides, you can only override the `ResponderBox` version thanks to the `@objc` annotation. If you tried to override the struct version the compiler would give you an error.

### Modals

In the same way I only move forward using the Containers, I also only move backwards using them. One of the rules I follow is that "the Container that presented something should also dismiss it". However iOS throws a spanner in that by default because regardless of what does the presenting, the window's `rootViewController` is the value returned by the presented items `next` value.

What this means in our example is; Our presented `NewMessageNavigationController` would return the `HomeTabController` as its `next` responder instead of the `MessageListNavigationController` that presented it.

Luckily we can work around this also using [View Controller Containment](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/featuredarticles/ViewControllerPGforiPhoneOS/ImplementingaContainerViewController.html):

```swift
class ResponderController: UIViewController {
  private let nextOverride: UIResponder
  private let child: UIViewController

  init(containing: UIViewController, nextResponder: UIResponder) {
    self.nextOverride = nextResponder
    self.child = containing
    super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)
  }
  required init?(coder: NSCoder) {
    fatalError("init(coder:) has not been implemented")
  }
  
  override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    addChild(child)
    view.addSubview(child.view)
    
    child.view.frame = view.bounds
    child.view.autoresizingMask = [.flexibleWidth, .flexibleHeight]
    
    child.didMove(toParent: self)
  }
  override var next: UIResponder? {
    return nextOverride
  }
}

extension UIViewController {
    func presentModal(_ viewControllerToPresent: UIViewController, animated flag: Bool, completion: (() -> Void)? = nil) {
        let wrapper = ResponderController(containing: viewControllerToPresent, nextResponder: self)
        present(wrapper, animated: flag, completion: completion)
    }
}
```

By overriding `next` we can maintain a Responder Chain that matches how we actually construct the UI hierarchy. All you need to do is use `presentModal(_:animated:completion:)` instead of the usual `present(_:animated:completion:)` function.


## Recap

If you made it this far you probably have the idea but just to recap the rules I like to use when working with this pattern:

- Only Containers perform transitions; this includes push/pop, present/dismiss.
- Containers configure properties on a View Controller relevant to their duties; this includes properties like `title`, `navigationItem`s and `tabBarItem`s 

Much like the more common Coordinator pattern this certainly isn't a silver bullet. However I have had really good success using it a number of apps so I'd love to hear your feedback if you decide to try it. There are some quirks but overall I find it easier to _lean into_ UIKit rather than try to fight it.
